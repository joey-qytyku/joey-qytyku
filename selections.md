# My Code Samples

This file contains links to various bits of code I have written that are complete, functional, and representative of how I write programs.

Some links may change. I will do my best to update this file accordingly.

## [printf](https://github.com/joey-qytyku/OS-90-fixed/blob/master/SHARED/printf/printf2.c)

Implementation of the standard C function, printf, for 32-bit x86. Fully reentrant and extensible to different buffering and outputting methods.

## [strtoul and others](https://github.com/joey-qytyku/OS-90-fixed/blob/master/SHARED/strconv/strtoxyl.c)

## [intconv](https://github.com/joey-qytyku/OS-90-fixed/blob/master/SHARED/printf/intconv.asm)

Efficient assembly implementation of integer-to-string conversion. Converts numbers under 1 million in constant time.
